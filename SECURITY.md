# Security Policy

Shime is a free and open-source project. We take security very seriously and we appreciate any help in making Shime more secure.

## Supported Versions

Due to resource constraints, the only supported version of this Shime is the **latest available version**. Always use the latest version of Shime to ensure you have the latest security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have a **security-related issue** to report, please open [draft security advisory](https://github.com/RyanLua/Shime/security/advisories/new) and a collaborator will privately discuss the advisory with you directly and privately.

Once we have determined that the security issue is valid we will attempt to fix the issue as soon as possible. Once the issue has been resolved we will publish the security advisory along with the release of a new version of Shime.
